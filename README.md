# Mimic-it

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,
with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

Inspired by the popular Simon game, Mimic it is an enhanced memory test game based on remembering the random sequence of 6 coloured buttons generated and mimicing it.
